## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**model** | **String** | ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them. | 
**input** | Option<**String**> | The input text to use as a starting point for the edit. | [optional][default to ]
**instruction** | **String** | The instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt. | 
**n** | Option<**i32**> | How many edits to generate for the input and instruction. | [optional][default to 1]
**temperature** | Option<**f32**> | What [sampling temperature](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277) to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.  We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.  | [optional][default to 1]
**top_p** | Option<**f32**> | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.  | [optional][default to 1]
